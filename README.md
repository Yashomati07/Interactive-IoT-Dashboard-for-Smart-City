# Interactive IoT Dashboard for Smart City
*A Web-Based Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard*

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Interactive IoT Dashboard for Smart City** is a web-based system developed using **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.  
It provides **real-time visualization** of Smart City parameters such as **Air Quality Index (AQI)**, **weather information**, and **flood-level monitoring**, enabling efficient monitoring and quick decision-making for city operations.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build a responsive, real-time Smart City monitoring interface  
- Display live data from connected IoT devices and sensors  
- Create an intuitive and clean dashboard layout using HTML/CSS  
- Update data dynamically using JavaScript-based UI logic  
- Ensure fast and easily understandable visualization for operators  

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used
- **HTML5** – Page structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – Styling, responsive design, visual formatting  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Dynamic DOM updates, data handling  
- **VS Code, Git, Linux/Ubuntu** – Development environment  

## 📡 Key Features
- Real-time visualization of AQI, weather, and flood sensor data  
- Clean and responsive UI built with HTML/CSS  
- JavaScript-based dynamic updates for smooth user experience  
- Color-coded indicators and alerts for quick status recognition  
- Modular, maintainable dashboard structure  

## 🔧 My Contribution
- Designed and developed the **dashboard UI** using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript  
- Integrated live IoT sensor data into the dashboard in real time  
- Implemented alert indicators, data formatting, and dynamic UI behavior  
- Tested and optimized the dashboard for reliability and responsiveness  
- Created documentation explaining workflow and configuration steps  

## 📂 How It Works
1. IoT sensors collect AQI, weather, and flood-level data  
2. Data is transmitted through a gateway to the monitoring system  
3. The dashboard updates values dynamically to reflect live status  
4. JavaScript ensures smooth UI transitions and real-time visualization
