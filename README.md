# Interactive IoT Dashboard for Smart City (ThingsBoard)
*A Web-Based Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard*

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Interactive IoT Dashboard for Smart City** is a web-based monitoring system developed using **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**, integrated with the **ThingsBoard IoT platform**.  
It visualizes real-time data for Smart City parameters such as **Air Quality Index (AQI)**, **weather**, and **flood monitoring**, enabling efficient monitoring and decision-making for city operations.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build a responsive, real-time Smart City monitoring dashboard  
- Integrate IoT devices with the ThingsBoard platform  
- Display live telemetry data with smooth UI updates  
- Use clean web technologies for a structured and intuitive interface  
- Ensure fast and accurate visual representation of alerts and sensor values  

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used
- **HTML5** – Page layout and structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling, responsive design, UI formatting  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Dynamic data updates, DOM manipulation  
- **ThingsBoard IoT Platform** – Telemetry ingestion, widgets, rule engine  
- **VS Code, Git, Linux/Ubuntu** – Development environment  

## 📡 Key Features
- Real-time visualization of AQI, weather, and flood-level data  
- Color-coded alerts for quick status recognition  
- Responsive and lightweight UI using HTML/CSS  
- JavaScript-based dynamic DOM updates  
- Integration with ThingsBoard widgets and telemetry streams  

## 🔧 My Contribution
- Built the **dashboard UI** using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript  
- Integrated live telemetry from IoT devices into ThingsBoard  
- Configured ThingsBoard dashboard widgets, keys, and rule chains  
- Handled UI logic, data formatting, and real-time updates  
- Performed debugging, optimization, and documentation  

## 📂 How It Works
1. IoT devices send environmental sensor data to ThingsBoard  
2. ThingsBoard processes telemetry using rule chains  
3. The dashboard pulls live values through configured widgets  
4. JavaScript enhances UI interactions and updates elements dynamically
